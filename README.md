# Kieda's Orbiter

A Linux Warframe companion app. Tracks your inventory, relics, rivens, mastery progress, market prices, and live world state — all in one place.

Built on top of [wfinfo-ng](https://github.com/knoellle/wfinfo-ng) by knoellle, with a full PySide6 GUI and many additional features.

## Requirements

- **Linux** (Windows support planned)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **PySide6** — installed automatically via pip
- **Tesseract OCR** — for the relic reward overlay (`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` / `sudo dnf install tesseract`)
- **Rust + Cargo** — only needed to build the OCR detector binary ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **Steam + Proton** — Warframe must be run through Steam (EE.log is auto-detected)
- **warframe-api-helper** — included binary for inventory reading (Linux x86-64)

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/GoblinOfChaos/Kieda-s-Orbiter.git
cd Kieda-s-Orbiter

# 2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. (Optional) Build the relic reward OCR detector
cargo build --release --bin orbiter

# 4. Download the latest Warframe item/price data
./update.sh

# 5. Launch
./control-panel.sh
```

The app will auto-detect your EE.log and inventory paths on first launch.
If auto-detection fails, set them manually in **Status & Tools → File Paths**.

---

## Usage

- **Launch**: Run `./control-panel.sh` or use the desktop entry (if installed)
- **Inventory**: Run Warframe with `warframe-api-helper` active, then click **Refresh Data**
- **Relic reward overlay**: The `orbiter` binary watches EE.log and pops up automatically. Press **F12** to trigger manually
- **Riven overlay**: Opens automatically when you view a riven mod in-game

---

## EE.log location

Auto-detected for most Steam/Proton setups. Manual path can be set in **Status & Tools → File Paths**. Default location:

```
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/230410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Warframe/EE.log
```

## Themes

Switch themes in **Status & Tools → UI Theme**. Six themes available, including colorblind-safe options based on Warframe's Focus schools:

| Theme | Style | Colorblind safe for |
