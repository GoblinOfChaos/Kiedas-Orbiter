# Kieda's Orbiter

A Linux Warframe companion app. Tracks your inventory, relics, rivens, mastery progress, market prices, and live world state — all in one place.

Built on top of [wfinfo-ng](https://github.com/knoellle/wfinfo-ng) by knoellle, with a full PySide6 GUI and many additional features.

## Requirements

- **Linux** (Windows support planned)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **PySide6** — installed automatically via pip
- **Tesseract OCR** — for the relic reward overlay (`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` / `sudo dnf install tesseract`)
- **Rust + Cargo** — only needed to build the OCR detector binary ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **Steam + Proton** — Warframe must be run through Steam (EE.log is auto-detected)
- **warframe-api-helper** — included binary for inventory reading (Linux x86-64)

---

## Installation

### Windows

1. Install **[Python 3.11+](https://python.org/downloads/)** — check **"Add Python to PATH"** during install
2. Download and unzip this repo ([Download ZIP](https://github.com/GoblinOfChaos/Kieda-s-Orbiter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
3. Open the folder and double-click **`Install Windows.bat`**
4. After it finishes, launch from the **Start Menu** or double-click **`Start Kieda's Orbiter.bat`**

### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoblinOfChaos/Kieda-s-Orbiter.git
cd Kieda-s-Orbiter
./install.sh
```

Or equivalently:
```bash
python install.py
```

The installer will:
1. Check for Python 3.11+ and Tesseract OCR
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Build the relic reward OCR binary (if Rust is installed)
4. Download the latest Warframe item and price data
5. Download `warframe-api-helper` for your platform
6. Install the app icon and **add it to your start menu**

After installing, search for **"Kieda's Orbiter"** in your start menu (or application launcher) to launch it.

On first launch, go to **Status & Tools → File Paths** to verify your EE.log was auto-detected correctly.

### Manual steps (if you prefer)

<details>
<summary>Expand for manual installation steps</summary>

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Build the relic reward OCR detector — requires Rust
cargo build --release --bin orbiter

# Download Warframe data
./update.sh

# Install icon + start menu entry
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps
cp orbiter.svg ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
cp kiedas-orbiter.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

# Launch
./control-panel.sh
```

## Usage

### Getting started

1. Launch the app from your start menu (search "Kieda's Orbiter")
2. Go to **Status & Tools** and check that **Detector** shows "Running"
3. If EE.log wasn't auto-detected, set it in **Status & Tools → File Paths**
4. Click **Refresh Data** after running Warframe to sync your inventory

---

### Relic reward overlay

When you crack a relic, the overlay pops up automatically showing each reward with your ownership status:

- 🟢 **NEED** — you've never had this part, take it
- 🔵 **OWNED x2** — you already have copies
- 🟡 **CRAFTED** — you've built/mastered this before

**Tips:**
- The overlay appears ~2-3 seconds after the reward screen — it needs time to capture and process
- **Drag it** anywhere on screen — position is remembered between sessions
- Press **F12** to trigger it manually (useful for testing)
- Change which monitor it appears on in **Status & Tools → Overlay Display**
- Adjust how long it stays visible in **Status & Tools → Advanced Settings → Overlay display duration**

---

### Inventory sync

Inventory data comes from `warframe-api-helper` which reads your game memory:

1. Launch Warframe and get to the main orbiter
2. The helper reads your inventory automatically in the background
3. Click **Refresh Data** in **Status & Tools** to rebuild all derived data
4. All tabs (Missing Parts, Relic Planner, etc.) update immediately

---

### Relic Planner

1. Click **Add All Missing Parts** or **Add Never Obtained** to populate your need list
2. The right panel shows relics ranked by how many of your needed parts they drop
3. Green rows = relics you already own, red = vaulted, normal = unvaulted but unowned
4. Check **Show owned relics only** to filter to just what you can run right now
5. Double-click a part in the left panel to add it individually

---

### Riven Grader

The riven overlay appears automatically when you view a riven in your Arsenal. It shows:
- Grade (Great / Good / OK / Weak / Reroll)
- Stats comparison if you just rerolled
- All your rivens ranked by quality

The grader uses roll data from `riven_good_rolls.json` — you can edit this file to customise what counts as a good roll for each weapon.

---

### Keeping data fresh

- **Update Game Data** — refreshes item prices and the item database (~daily)
- **Refresh WFCD Cache** — pulls fresh item data from WFCD GitHub (~weekly)
- **Fetch Live Prices** — gets real-time platinum prices from warframe.market (takes ~5 min due to rate limits)

---

### Bazzite / KDE Wayland notes

The overlay uses `spectacle` for screen capture via the KDE XDG portal. If the overlay appears but focus is lost from Warframe, this usually means the app was launched from a Flatpak environment (like VS Code). Always launch from your start menu or a clean terminal, not from inside VS Code.

---

## EE.log location

Auto-detected for most Steam/Proton setups. Manual path can be set in **Status & Tools → File Paths**. Default location:

```
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/230410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Warframe/EE.log
```

---

## Themes

Switch themes in **Status & Tools → UI Theme**. Six themes available, including colorblind-safe options based on Warframe's Focus schools:

| Theme | Style | Colorblind safe for |
|---|---|---|
| Kieda's Default | Sapphire blue + gold | — |
| Madurai | Fire red/orange | Deuteranopia |
| Vazarin | Deep navy + cyan | Protanopia |
| Naramon | High-contrast charcoal | All types |
| Unairu | Earth/amber | Deuteranopia + Protanopia |
| Zenurik | Indigo/violet | Tritanopia |
